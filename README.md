# Flappy Bird - Mini Game in JavaScript



Welcome to the Flappy Bird mini game implemented in JavaScript! This is a simple project that recreates the classic Flappy Bird game, where you control a bird and must avoid crashing into pipes while flying.

How to Play
Open the Game: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

### Control the Bird:

Use the Space, Up Arrow, or X Key to make the bird jump and avoid crashing into pipes.
The goal is to pass through as many pipes as possible without crashing.

### Scoring:

Each time you pass through a pair of pipes, you earn 1 point.
The total score is displayed in the top-left corner of the game.
### Game Over:

If the bird collides with a pipe or falls off the screen, the game ends.
To restart the game after it ends, simply press any jump key (Space, Up Arrow, or X Key).
